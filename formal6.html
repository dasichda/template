				<p>	Research may be the most important aspect of engineering. Nothing nowadays is created completely from scratch. Prior designs and ideas are always going to be floating around the design table and different aspects from all of them are going to be taken into consideration. Researching outdated designs helps engineers create the best products possible. This is done by looking at what worked in the previous design, and what did not. By looking at what worked in previous designs allows engineers to tweak those designs to make them even better, and by looking at what did not work allows them to see what should not be done. Or if they think the failed designs are a good idea, they can also look at what made them fail, and improve on those designs. Research not only helps by giving us ideas from existing designs, but it also allows us to find out what the best material to make something out of is. This is a constant problem in the electrical engineering field, finding a material that will transfer large amounts of electricity with no resistance, which is also reasonably priced to be used in everyday electronics. Scientists and engineers all around the world are working on finding that material every single day.</p>
