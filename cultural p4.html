			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>	I believe an effective solution to the problem of mobile phones ruining our society’s communications skills would be simply informing the public about the problem at hand. The best you can do is let them know what is happening because of the increase in mobile phone use, since you cannot take anything away that is already there. Programs should be put in to place to show everyone what a lack of communication can do to you and what it can lead to later in life. With mobile phone usage becoming more and more prominent in younger children, it is most important to let them know of this issue before it can become a problem. Informing the children of this issue is going to be the hardest part, considering they are the least worried about their futures, and always being on a mobile device is sort of “fun” in their eyes. If a school sees that a lot of the students are on their phones a lot, they should put a no phone policy into place, there should also be mandatory meetings during school to inform them of this issue, especially if it is getting in the way of learning.</p>
			<p>	For teenagers, there should be similar programs during school that are given to the younger children. It is very critical to get the point across to the teenagers, because that is one of the last chances you will have to have them all together in an organized fashion. The program should go over how a lack of face-to-face communication will cause poor social skills. They should explain to the kids that good social skills are an extremely crucial part of the business world. The kids should understand that they will need to participate in many interviews over the years, and for the interviews to go well and for them to get the job they want, they will need to have the best social skills possible. It will be hard to get the teenagers to understand this point, because they are they ones who are the most tied up in all of the texting and social networking. It is very essential that they leave high school with this in mind though, because they are the next generation who is going into the labor force.</p>
