				<p>	Writing is a very important tool in the engineering field that is fully utilized every single day. If you feel that you have an idea that fits the problem presented, it is likely that you are not just going to run to your manager and present the idea without any written work. They may not even take you seriously until you have some sort of plan and ideas written down in an organized manner. Usually when presenting an idea, you will create some sort of slideshow presentation and have all of you ideas in there in an organized fashion. Once you are ready to present your ideas, you will go in front of a board of higher representatives or just your current team for the project, it all depends on what you are trying to present and when. Presentations are not the only thing that writing is used for though, during an engineering project, one must document every single thing that is happening during the entire process. Engineers cannot take the risk of getting everything done and not having any documentation on exactly what they did, when they did it, and most importantly how they did it. It is also very important to keep a detailed set of instructions on how to create what your team is creating and designing. A design will not do anybody any good if they do not know the exact steps on how to recreate everything in it.</p>
