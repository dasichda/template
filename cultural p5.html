			<h2>Anticipated Results</h2>
			<p>	The results of these programs being put into place could be extremely helpful. With the way things are going currently, a large portion of the working class is going to be below average when it comes to communicating effectively. If these programs were to go into place, a lot more would get done in the work place. Better communication will ultimately lead to a smooth, more stable working environment. If the people are able to communicate better, they will also get along better and there would be less conflict altogether. These programs will also lead to stronger friendships being made throughout the years. One is not able to become involved in great friendships unless there is good communication going on between the two. With better social skills, friends will be able to work their problems out directly, whereas a lot of problems in this day and age are taken to texting and even social media.</p>
