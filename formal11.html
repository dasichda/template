			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			
				<p>Communication is an immense part of the engineering process for all types of engineers. They must be able to communicate with each other effectively, but also be able to document and record information in an effective way. Being able to interpret writing is just as important. Engineers rely on each other to operate effectively; this can only be done by the sharing of information and research of many engineers. All in all, without communication, engineers would be working by themselves. Engineering has never been done like this. It has always been a collaborative effort from a huge group of people to create and design the best products they can possibly design.</p>
