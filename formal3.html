			<h1>Communication</h1>

				<p>Communication in the world of electrical engineering is extremely important. No engineer will ever work alone on a project with no outside help. This is why writing, reading, and research are key aspects in the engineering field. If we were missing even one of those things, the entire engineering practice would not work. Engineers rely on communication to share ideas with other engineers. Ideas must be shared as an engineer because it is very unlikely that one single person has the ultimate solution to every problem that will be at hand. It is not all about sharing ideas though. Writing and reading are utilized as an engineer is recording information throughout the job, as well as creating a design plan through a series of charts. Time is very valuable as an engineer, so they must use every resource they have to make sure they make the deadline. If an engineer does not make the deadline, it is likely that the entire project will be a failure.</p>
