			<h1>Interview 2</h1>
			
				<p>My second interview was with someone who is currently working in the engineering field with Chrysler as a mechanical engineer, Jamie Jyawook. My first question to him was “How has technology improved your workplace in the past few years?” His response was similar to an earlier portion of this essay. He stated that with the introduction of the Internet and web chatting, the sharing of information has become so much easier. They used to have to make multiple phone calls and send back-to-back emails asking different people different questions. Now, he says he can just hop on the computer, notify a group of people that he needs to have a videoconference, and within minutes he can have a huge group of people at his disposal to help him with his current projects.</p>
				<p>My second question to Jamie was “What kind of research do you conduct on a daily basis?” He said research is a huge part of what he does daily. What his department mostly does is they purchase the cars of the competition and tear them apart piece by piece. This had never even crossed my mind. This is the most important thing to do in his eyes; he says that without doing this, they could be missing a huge step in their design. They also take competitors vehicles that have been said to have problems and tear these apart; they want to make sure not to make the same mistakes as the competition.</p>
