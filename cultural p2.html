			<h2>Cultural Artifact</h2>
			<p>	The cultural artifact I will be relating this essay to is going to be a YouTube video with the name, “I Forgot My Phone” (CharstarleneTV). This video is about a day in the life of a young woman who is not controlled by her phone, but is surrounded by her friends who are. While the whole video is not just about communication itself, it still shows how mobile phones are starting to take over the lives of a lot of people for the worse. The first thing that happens in this video is that this girl wakes up next to her boyfriend, who is already starting off his day surfing the web, checking social networks, or texting his friends before he even gets out of bed. A couple scenes later, she is out to lunch with a group of her friends, who at first seem to be partially a part of the conversation she is trying to have, but slowly become sucked into their phones, as if they are unable to pay attention to a real conversation going on right in front of them. She is then left sitting there surrounded by her friends on their mobile devices. The next scene demonstrates another similar problem that mobile phones are causing, the need to document everything through pictures. The young woman is walking down the beach when she notices a man proposing to his girlfriend, who immediately pulls out his phone and points it on the two of them. Instead of trying to truly live the moment and only take back memories, people are starting to ruin the actual experience of doing something, only to have photographic proof of the event. The next scene is the most relevant to this essay. In this scene there are two girls on a swing set, one on her phone, and one swinging. This just goes to show that mobile phones are not only hindering direct communication peers, but also the communication that is involved when making new friends. It is also sad that this little girl would rather be sitting on her phone, which she could do at any time, instead of enjoying the beautiful weather and the people around her. The rest of the scenes just cover topics that I have already discussed from the previous scenes.</p>
