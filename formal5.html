				<p>	Reading plays a huge role in the engineering field. There are always going to be those days that you are given stacks and stacks of papers to sift through and collect their information. Sometimes you will be given technical reports that provide background information on the project you are about to start. It will always be in your best interest to learn as much as you can from these, as they will help you tremendously when starting your design with your team. You may also be given design specifications, in which you will have to pull all of the important information out of that given by the consumer requesting the product. If even one small piece of information is lost or left out, the entire design will become useless, as the consumer is not looking for a design that is almost what they asked for, they are looking for a design that is exactly what they asked for right down to the smallest details. Not a single detail may be missed.</p>
