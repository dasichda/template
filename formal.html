Especially something as complicated as electrical engineering. Out of all of the engineering practices, I would say electrical engineering is one of the hardest to explain to the average person. Mechanical engineering is somewhat simple in comparison, as everything that they work with involves something that you can physically see, touch and manipulate to your liking. Electrical engineering, however, involves a force that you are not even able to see, let alone touch. Everything is conducted based on how the system should work, not how it is actually going to work. As electrical engineers, our job is to know exactly how an electrical system is going to work before it is put into action. If we were to just design based on trial and error, something could go terribly wrong and someone could really get hurt. Electricity is not something to be taken lightly. Now to get more into the specifics of electrical engineering.</p>
