			<h1>Technology</h1>
							<p>	Technology ties all of these principals together. With the vast improvements of technology in these past few years, communication in the engineering field has never been easier. With the introduction of cellular phones and the Internet, engineers can now have mobile conferences with anybody around the world at any time. It used to be so hard to relay information between buildings, each of which had important details on the project of the other. Technology has also made research many times easier. With three-dimensional modeling becoming more accessible, products can now be tested without even having a hard copy. It can all be done on the computer. Prototyping is now much easier with the introduction of three-dimensional printers, which are becoming a more cost effective option. If a consumer needs a product a certain size and shape, the engineers can just create a hard copy and send it off to them to let them okay the design.</p>

			<p>The article “Basics of Design Engineering: CAD/CAM,” really shows how technology is improving and contributing to the advances in the engineering field. The main purpose of the article is to explain the advances of computer aided design software and three-dimensional printers in recent years. Computer aided design is allowing engineers to be able to work with their products before ever even physically touching them. Some really advanced programs can even simulate stress. This is extremely helpful to engineers because it is very nice to know how well certain designs are going to hold up as opposed to others. Now instead of building all of the models physically and testing them individually, a simple computer program can set all of the designs in perfect conditions, and apply the same amount of stress to each of them. After it does all of this, it gives you a huge list of the weak points and a lot of other statistics, which can then be compared to the other designs. The most innovative point in this article is the aspect of three-dimensional printing. As mentioned before, this is allowing engineers to create full-scale prototypes of their designs with extreme ease. Before three-dimensional printing, engineers used to have to build the final product itself, or use some other type of very costly and inefficient casting process to get the same effect. Technology is really speeding up the entire engineering process.<p/>
