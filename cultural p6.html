			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>	In conclusion, the younger generations are spending an unhealthy amount of time on their mobile phones. They are using their mobile phones when they should be communicating face-to-face. This is leading to a lot less communication in person, which makes them less able to communicate effectively when they really need to. A great way to solve this problem would be to start up programs in the schools to inform the younger population of this rapidly increasing problem. They should be informed that while it may not be a problem to them now, it will become a problem when they are searching for their dream job and cannot properly communicate to an employer through an interview.</p>
