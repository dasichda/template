			<p>This is weird. I have never blogged before in my life. I do not even know what I am going to write about. I hope this class is not too difficult. I have enough going on with my other classes and having to worry about a writing class when I am not going to be pursuing that as a career is quite annoying. I have never been a bad writer; I just procrastinate to the extreme. That is going to be the death of me for this class. Hopefully by the end of the semester I learn to do my work ahead of time. It is so much nicer to get things done early and not have to worry about them. I am going to try it out with this first assignment. Although, chances are I will end up putting it off to the last minute… Oh well. No matter how long I put things off, they always end up getting done. I have never been one to completely ignore an assignment, and I also have the ability to sit down for hours on end and complete a lot of work at one time. I can see that helping me in this class. That cannot continue through the entire terms though. I have to force myself to schedule time to work on the papers. Spacing things out is key to curbing a procrastination problem. I hate procrastinating, but it always sounds so much better to do something “tomorrow” as apposed to in the exact moment. Hopefully I can control that though. It is so rewarding to have an assignment done and over with. Having to worry about due dates is the worst and doing something the day before it is due is very stressful.</p>

			<p>The Lived Experiences essay does not look too bad. I already know what I am going to write about, car audio. Car audio involves a lot of electrical circuit and to set a complete system up properly you need to have an above average understanding of how circuits work. The word count freaks me out for this paper though. It is only the first paper and I have to somehow come up with at least 1200 words on this subject. That should not be extremely difficult though. The rubric says you need to have a very detailed description of the piece of technology you are going to use as your topic. My technology involves many parts, and most people do not know what they are at all. A very detailed description is going to be needed, because most of the people who are going to be interested in this essay are not going to be car audio experts. Also, car audio in general is very complicated, so a vast description is going to be needed for each part that I am going to discuss. I should easily be able to type a few pages on that. This prompt actually made me realize that car audio is what helped me decide to be an electrical engineer. I never really noticed it, but I just wanted to learn as much as I could about it. It was also very interesting to me to learn about car audio. I am very pleased with this essay topic.</p>

			<p>The purpose of the video is to inform the audience of the story of his Uncle Ronnie. He really looked up to his uncle, because his mom talked about him so highly. The main purpose of the video is to let the audience know that life gets better, no matter what is going on in your life at that moment. The speaker soon realized he was gay, and found out that that was also his uncle’s path in life. The video achieves this by dramatically speaking of the story that the speaker has to share. It is spoken in a dark, poem tone. The writing at the beginning also conveys more of a serious message and brings the watcher to a more serious perspective. Poetry can be a great way to get a message across to an audience. The way it is spoken is very dramatic and serious, and it brings the audience into the story. The structure of this message starts out with a silent portion of video, where there is nothing on the screen except chalkboard writing. This is a great way at getting the message across. Next, the speaker comes in and gives a little background information about his uncle. This is a crucial part of the story, as the background information makes the rest of the story relatable. He then starts talking about how his uncle was gay, as is he. This brings light upon the speaker, and how he is relevant to this whole thing. Next, he brings up that his uncle shot himself, leaving the speaker with nobody to talk to about what he is going through. He sees it as selfish and is very upset about the fact. This video can help me with my lived experiences essay by showing me how an effective structure can make a message a lot more meaningful. Structure is probably the most important part of an essay, and this video demonstrates this perfectly.</p>

			<p>Overall I would say my Lived Experiences essay turned out pretty good. I just barely made the word count, which is what I was most worried about. I feel like I went on and on about the technical descriptions, but it seemed necessary, as a lot of people have absolutely no idea what I would be talking about if I did not describe everything in such detail. I also described what goes in to installing a car audio system. I described how to install the speakers, swap out the battery and alternator, how to properly wire the amp, how fuses work, everything you needed to know. It was so detailed that it could probably be used as a guide to help someone install his or her own system. I hope I get a decent grade on it. The professor said everyone should get at least a 3.5 if you turn in all of the work on time. So now I just have to wait and see what she gives me. Waiting for grades is so stressful, and they are almost always below what you are expecting. I am not a bad writer though, so I am pretty confident that I will get at least a 3.5. I am hoping to leave this class with at least a 3.5 average gpa. The better grades you get freshman year, the less stressful the next three years will be, at least that is what I hear. I also need at least a 3.0 average to be accepted into the college of engineering, which I should be able to get no problem.</p>

			<p>The Cultural Analysis project is stressing me out. I have absolutely no idea what I am going to write about. Nothing that I can easily find a lot of information on is coming to mind. I am sure I will be able to think of something though… Eventually. I will just have to ask a few people, I am not good at coming up with these kinds of ideas, because I am not really a person who looks too deeply for a message in a video or song, I just enjoying listening to them or watching them. So this assignment could take me a little while to start. I just need to not procrastinate and I should be fine. That is going to be a challenge for me though. I need to space things out and make a set schedule for when I should have certain parts of the assignment done. I am not a very organized person though, but this should be a good start. Organization is an important key to success. I should really start working on my organization. At first I thought the word count for the lived experiences essay was huge, this one is 500 words longer! I have no idea what I am even writing about yet, let alone what I am going to write 1700 words on. It will get done though, it always does. I just have to work in set intervals and make sure I compose a solid rough draft. Once the rough draft is done, the final is not too far from that.</p>

			<p>Code Academy is going to be the death of me. It is going to take so long to finish all twelve of the assignments that we have to have finished by the end of the term. Again, procrastination is going to be a problem here. It seems easy enough in my mind to space out twelve assignments in fifteen weeks, but it is never actually that easy for me for some reason. Procrastination is inevitable. Hopefully by the end of all of these lessons I have an above average understanding of how to HTML code a website. That could be a very useful skill to have in the future when I am looking for a job. Not a lot of people even know what HTML is, let alone how to utilize it to create an entire website. I could even create a website on my own time if I ever find a use for one. So far it seems pretty easy. Remembering which code does what is probably the hardest part. Putting in paragraphs is probably the most annoying part. You are not able to just indent or hit enter for a new paragraph. You have to create an entirely new set of paragraphs for every single paragraph. This is mostly a problem when you are trying to upload a 1500 word essay to your website. It just involves a whole lot of copy and pasting, which can get very annoying.</p>

			<p>The Cultural Analysis project was not as bad as I thought it would be. The subject of my project is how teenagers, and even adults sometimes, are on their phones way too much. It is really becoming a problem with my generation though. Kids are always glued to their phones, and it is hurting their social skills. Not only that, but it is also making them lose touch with their friends who are not into all of that technology and social networking. I for one am not into it at all. It makes me really mad when my friends are just sitting there on their phones when I am trying to talk to them. It is almost as if you can get ahold of them better using your phone when you are right next to them. It is ridiculous. The video I used to demonstrate this was a video I stumbled upon a few months ago. It was really an eye opener when I saw it, because it was completely true. It was just about a girl who was living a normal life, but all of her friends are always on their phones. Even her boyfriend is lying with her and he is holding his phone above her head. It is just extremely annoying when people do this, so I thought it would be a great cultural issue to write about.</p>

			<p>I got a great grade on the lived experiences project. It was much better than I expected actually. I am on track to get a 4.0 in this class so far. I thought it was very long and dragged out, but I guess the professor did not think so. We were just introduced to the Formal Research project. She said this is the most information intensive project, which makes me nervous. I never really liked gathering copious amounts of information on any subject, but this is about my specific major, so it should be really helpful for this class, as well as the rest of my college career. I am going to use this assignment as an opportunity to learn as much as I can about electrical engineering. You can never learn too much about what you are going to be doing for the rest of your life. The interviews are what I am worried about. I have no idea who I am going to interview. I do not know many engineers, let alone electrical engineers. I also do not know who to get ahold of to get the educators side of the interview. I might try email Professor Hinds today. Hopefully he has time to get back to me. Either that or I will go see him really quick after lecture Wednesday. I’m sure I will be all right. The word count is a huge problem again for this project. 3000 words are well over eight pages. I do not know what I am going to write about for that long. I am just going to gather as much information as possible, and go from there. Hopefully it turns out all right.</p>

			<p>I personally believe that education is a very important part of being successful. With the way the job market is nowadays, someone who has an education is much more valuable than someone without. Almost all of the high paying jobs that are available require at least two years of college to be qualified to work them, and the very high paying jobs, such as doctors, require over ten years of formal schooling after high school. What college does is give you a specified skill. Without any specified skills, you are only qualified to work a job that most of the general population can do easily. With that being said, it is not impossible to have an extremely valuable skill without going to college, like Mark Zuckerberg. He had a very good understanding of computers before his college experience. This allowed him to provide a useful service, Facebook, which was very important to a lot of people. It was so important to these people that major companies wanted to advertise on his website. This meant that Mark was getting paid to allow these people to post advertisements. The more people on his website meant the more money he would get. This is how he became a self-made billionaire. So overall, you are able to be very successful without going to college, but it is obviously a much more sure route to take to make sure you lead a successful life.</p>

			<p>The commercial for the Chrysler 200 is done in a very effective way. The imagery of Detroit was a vital point of the commercial. They depicted Detroit as a strong, independent city. This is effective because when someone is buying a car, they want to know it has the power and durability that is well worth the money they are spending on it. People would not buy the car if it were depicted as weak. The voiceover is also crucial to the commercial. The voice was very bold and strong. This also makes people associate the car with being durable and reliable. The voice is also very smooth and soothing. It provides the comfort that is needed when deciding to buy a certain car or when you are trying to make the decision on which car to buy. The inclusion of the “Lose Yourself” by Eminem instrumental was also a key to the success of this commercial’s message. The idea of “Lose Yourself” is to just go all out and do your absolute best, because you only have one chance, and you can’t mess it up. This is probably the most important underlying message. A couple reasons for this are that Eminem is from Detroit himself, and people want the best of the best car available for their money. Having someone actually from Detroit is important, the car is made in Detroit, and Detroit is a very proud city. All of these aspects lead to a very successful car commercial.</p>

			<p>Code Academy is not so bad anymore. I am starting to pick up on the various codes and what they do. I am a little more than half way through, and there is still so much more to learn. The whole purpose of HTML does not really make sense to me. I do not understand why you need to have that sort of code to make certain things happen. I also do not understand how the computer looks at that code and processes it into something completely different. There should be an easier way to change the color or font of things and move certain aspects of the webpage into a new position. Who programmed the computer to read that code and process it into a new form? On the other hand, the formal research paper is going well. I am gathering a lot of useful information that will really help me through the rest of my major. I have already learned more about my own major than I knew before, and I am even surer about my career choice. I still have to get those interviews though. Professor Hinds never emailed me back, so I will probably see him after lecture very soon. Hopefully he had time to see me. I do not know who I will interview if I cannot get ahold of him.</p>
			
			<h1>Blog 12</h1>
			<p>I finally finished my formal research paper. It was not as bad as I thought it would be. I just barely made the word count, which I did not think it was a problem. I had so much information to write about, and I wrote as much on each subject as I could. I notice that the closer I come to the word count, the less quality my paper has, and by the conclusion, I am just trying to be done with it. I need to work on my conclusion writing. The conclusion is seen by a lot of people as the most important part of the essay. It is the last thing that the reader will see, which is probably the last thing that will remember. The entire essay could be amazing, but if the conclusion is very poor, the reader may deem the entire essay as poor as well. Oh well, I am just glad to have that paper done. It was by far the most time consuming. Procrastination was also not as big of a problem for this. I was sick for a lot of the time this paper was assigned, but I still managed to get it turned in on time, even though I got an extension. I hate putting things off, but it always sounds better to do something the next day. I really need to work on that. Hopefully by the end of this class I have my procrastination curbed. Solving that problem will make the rest of my college years go much more smoothly.

			<p>The end of the semester is coming very quickly. It is extremely stressful. I am not too worried about writing class, but all of my other classes have major assignments due very soon. I should be fine though. The gpa boost from this class should allow me to make the dean’s list. That’s all I really want. My main concern for writing class is this new multimodal remix project. I am very thankful that I found a few friends in this class; otherwise I do not know whose group I would be in. We are already getting a jump on the topic and proposal of the project. We are going to be creating a documentary on gun control. We picked this because there is a ton of information on it. I do not necessarily agree with the position that our group chose, but I will be able to handle it for the sake of not starting an argument. I cannot wait for this project to be over though. I feel like this is going to be the most time consuming project of them all. I do not really understand where it fits in the writing category though. We have not really done any intensive writing and I do not see where we are going to. Oh well, if it will get us a good grade I do not care. I am probably going to be the one editing the video though, for I am the only one with decent video editing software, and I have a decent understanding of how to use it. It will be alright though.</p>
			
			<h1>Blog 14</h1>
			<p>My group’s multimodal remix project is coming together really well. We have already gathered all of the information and video that we need. Now we just have to put it all together in the video editing software. That should not take too much time at all. We are also doing a few voice overs of quotes said by various people. The software that I am using allows this to be done very easily. It’s just a matter of choosing where to start recording, and clicking one little button. The project is set up very smoothly also. We start the video out with a bunch of quotes with the background sound of Barack Obama’s anti gun speech. I am not very fond of the speech, but it will serve its purpose for this assignment. The rest of the assignment is just various mass shootings, such as Columbine. We also have a few interviews from our peers. We got a few opinions from each side, so that should help us introduce the counter-argument. There is also a video in there that puts the counter-argument into a good perspective. It shows that we are not creating a completely biased documentary, but allowing both sides to be heard. The ending is probably my favorite part though. It is ended with one simple question which allows the viewer to think critically about what they just saw, and ultimately make their mind up about how they feel about the issue.</p>

			<p>This is it, the final blog. These blogs were not so bad. Some weeks I would be lazy and not write one, then when I did decide I had to write one, I would have to write a few. Saving all of these until the very end of the semester would not have been fun to make at all. I am just glad that they are almost done, along with the semester. Hopefully I walk out of this class with a good grade. That is all I want. I have been getting 4.0s consistently on all of my papers, along with the ten points extra credit towards he cultural analysis assignment. Hopefully the extra credit can make up for the homework assignment I got a zero on. I had no idea what we were supposed to do for that assignment though, I did not really see it as fair that I got a zero, oh well, it’s done with. The course retrospective project was also not very clear. I did not know if we were supposed to be writing a guide, a detailed description of the assignments, or just reflect upon what we did all semester, the whole class seemed to be confused on which direction the assignment was supposed to go. I wrote mine as I would like to see if I were an incoming freshman next year. It is a lot more personal, and assures the reader that with enough hard work and motivation, they can easily get a great grade in the class. Another thing I am psyched about it being finished with Code Academy. At first I did not see the point in doing the HTML in a writing class, but it was an easy thing to complete, and now I know how to code for my own website. Everything that I have learned in this class has made me a better writer overall. Coming into college, I hated writing essays with a passion. Now, I can easily sit down, think of a topic to research, and be on my way to completing a very well written essay. Adios WRA100!</p>
