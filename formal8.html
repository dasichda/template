			<h1>Scholarly Journal</h1>	
				<p>In the scholarly journal “Choosing engineering: Can I succeed and do I want to? A qualitative analysis framed in expectancy-value theory,” the author explains the mindset that must come with a student thinking about pursuing the field of engineering. The author, Holly Matusovich, explains that for the students to accomplish their objectives, they must first understand why they chose to pursue the engineering degrees in the first place. This may sound obvious, but it is a very real problem for a lot of current students. The key to succeeding in an engineering major is to be able to perceive oneself as a future engineer. Without the right mindset, you will not be able to do the best that you can do. A lot of students come into college not knowing at all what they want to do for the rest of their lives, which is completely understandable; it is a very tough decision to make at such a young age. Too many of these students choose careers based off of the amount of income they are going to take in, or what sounds interesting to them. While the second choice is the choice you should be steering towards, it still should not be the deciding factor. One must first learn everything there is to know about the field they are trying to pursue, only at this point should they make the decision to stick with that field. It is proven that you will succeed in a career that truly interests you.</p>
