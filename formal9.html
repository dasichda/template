			<h1>Interview 1</h1>
			
				<p>My first interview was with my engineering professor Timothy Hinds. I asked him “What advice would you give to a current engineering student pursuing electrical engineering?” He proceeded to tell me that any engineering student should become as familiar with current electronics as possible. Electronics are the future of all engineering. Technology is already a part of everyone’s everyday lives. It is only going to continue. For you to become the most valuable engineer you can be you must learn the ins and outs of these systems and be able to incorporate them into each and every design. This will make you the most valuable employee.</p>
