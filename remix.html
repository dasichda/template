			<p><strong>Composing in Context</strong></p>	<p>The issue our group chose was the necessity of gun control in the United States. This affected our composing by making us realize we had to make it relatable to the majority of the population. We had to have some sort of dramatic build up and then a series of lesser information to end on a good note. Composing for this issue helped me better understand the necessity of gun control because we had to research both sides. Getting information from just one side can make your viewpoint extremely biased, so we had to be sure to get an unbiased opinion. With an issue as controversial as gun control, that may not always be an easy thing to do. A problem that we had while composing our documentary was the organization of the video. We wanted to be sure to have a documentary that got every point across that we wanted to stress, but also flow nicely and make sense altogether. The audience played a huge role in the areas that we wanted to stress. We wanted to make sure that the audience could easily relate to everything we were talking about, but also make it dramatic enough to catch their attention.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>To select our topic, our group brainstormed various controversial topics. Once we had a good list of controversies, we looked at which one was the easiest to gather clear information for. Having enough usable information was a big deciding factor for us, as gun violence is a very well recorded figure. The most challenging part of the project for me was putting together the video itself. I had very little experience with the software I was using, so every step of the way I was trying to figure out new ways to make our documentary seem more natural and flow a bit better. Our approach was very systematic, we started the project by brainstorming figures we could include about gun control. Once we each had a good amount of usable information, we started to put them in order of importance, and necessity. After we had all of the information organized, we started to put the video together from beginning to end. </p>
<p><strong>Research</p>
<p>The resources that were most beneficial to us were the various statistics websites that are completely dedicated to gun violence in the US. Those websites made it easy to gather true and usable information for our documentary. The least beneficial resources were the ones that were very biased. It is hard to use information that completely ignores the other side of the arguing spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Our group interaction was, in my opinion, spectacular. Everybody was very eager to get together and work on the project, and there was not one time where someone in our group was not able to make it to a meeting. I believe working in groups on this project was very helpful. The gathering of the information would have been much harder for just a single person to do. More people means more opportunity to stumble on a goldmine of useful information.</p>
<p><strong>Project Management</strong></p>
<p>I think our group planned our work schedule very well. We met multiple times before the project was even close to being due. None of us wanted to worry about rushing near the deadline, and possibly having our project suffer because of it. If we had more time, we would probably take out some of the premade videos that we put in. It was hard to convey a lot of information at one time without boring the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Documentary Design</strong></p>
<p>I believe our most effective aspect of our design was the beginning of the documentary. We started it out with a series quotes on a fancy background that was easy on the eyes, paired with the background noise of President Obamaâ€™s speech on how gun control is necessary in the US. We made our design decisions as a group. If one person spoke up and did not like what the group was doing, we would talk about it, and either that person would agree with the rest, or we would change the design to fit the liking of the entire group. When you have a person working on something that they believe is not right, chances are they will start to care less about the project as a whole.</p>
