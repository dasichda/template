			<h2>Description of the Issue</h2>
			<p>This video may look ridiculous to someone who has not witnessed any of this before, making them think “how could someone be so fascinated by a mobile phone?” but I have seen all of these things first hand. Statistics show that 29% of people said that their mobile phone is the first and last thing that they look at on a regular day (Statistic Brain). This is a huge supporting fact that conveys the idea of the first scene of the video very well. I am even guilty for doing this on a regular basis without even realizing it. Or when I am hanging out with a large group of friends, it is not uncommon for at least half of the people to be on their phones at all times, nobody will even bat and eye. This is especially bad when everybody is sitting around waiting for something, such as food at a restaurant, when you either have the choice to talk to each other or entertain yourself on your phone. Studies show that 34% of people cannot go more than a few hours without checking their phone (Statistic Brain). Whenever possible, I try to attend electronic music festivals or shows. These shows are very similar to concerts, where there is a single center of attention that everyone is focused on. More than half of the people will deal with the hassle of getting a good shot while recording the show, instead of actually enjoying it to the full potential. This is not only their problem, but it is also a problem to everyone behind them actually trying to enjoy the show. Since everyone is holding their phones in the air trying to get a good shot, the people behind them are being denied their right to experience what they paid for because these people are distracting them and blocking the view. The scene with the little girl is the one that I have the least experience seeing. When I was that age, almost no one had a mobile phone. Mobile phones back then also could not do a fraction of the things that they are capable of doing now. The problem with my generation is bad enough; I cannot even imagine what it is going to be like with the next generation who are already born into extremely cheap and advanced devices at their fingertips.</p>
			<p>	The problem goes onto a bigger scale than just friends and family. With the lack of communication in modern life, a lot of people will not have the skills necessary to hold a decent job in the future. Every single career you could think of involves a tremendous amount of communication, whether it be interviewing, working together in teams, ordering inventory, and much more. Without the ability to communicate properly and smoothly, nothing is going to go as planned in the workplace.</p>
