			<h1>What Electrical Engineers Do</h1>
				<p>Electrical engineers help design, develop and test anything and everything involving electronics. If something has on on/off switch, chances are an electrical engineer had something to do with it. They also work on the electronics that one may not think of right off the bat, including generators, and global positioning systems. Not only do they design and test the equipment, but they also maintain it to make sure it is running at it fullest potential and running how it was intended to, as they are the people who created it, so they should know the absolute most about it.</p>
				<p>On a day-to-day basis, electrical engineers work in a collaborative team to get done what needs to get done for the day. The other engineers on the team will not necessarily be other electrical engineers though, some may include engineers such as architects, marketing and sales staff, manufacturers, technicians, and many more. Other types of engineers are needed in engineering teams so that there are multiple different viewpoints on a project. If you had an entire team of people who are taught to think exactly the same, some key aspects might be left out that a different practice specializes in dealing with. To create the best overall product, it must meet the requirements of everyone who is going to be using it, not just a small group of people.</p>
				<p>	Electrical engineers do a lot off the job site as well as on the job site. A large majority of all engineering work is done on the computer, making calculations, creating models, conducting research, or sharing ideas with other engineers around the world. They also spend a lot of time looking at technical drawings and design specifications that are given by the consumer. If the product is not built to the consumerâ€™s exact specifications, it is a failure, as they likely will have no use for the product. Presentations are also a huge part of any engineering practice. Presentations allow fellow engineers to share their ideas with their specialized team, this is extremely important, because without a team effort, the best product will most likely not be created. Ideas must be taken from many viewpoints and structured into one collaborative idea, which will hopefully be the best, most efficient choice. Electrical engineers are also sometimes required to go on the job site though. Some of these on site job tasks may include inspection of installed equipment to make sure it is running at its full potential that the consumer requires it for. During an inspection, the engineers will also collect data and run tests to compare with their other products, this ultimately allows them to improve the next design.</p>
				<p>	One can see that there is a lot going on in the field of electrical engineering. It is sometimes difficult to know exactly what a career entails. The purpose of this essay is to make that a bit clearer for someone who is considering the electrical engineering field, or for someone who just wants to know more about the engineering field in a whole. With a few minor details, this essay will relate to all engineering practices, as all engineers are working on achieving a better, easier life for all in the way of designing.</p>
