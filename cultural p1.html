			<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
			<p>	Cellphones are becoming much more prevalent in todayâ€™s society. Almost everyone has one, even children who have very little use for them. Mobile phones are also able to do much more than they have in the past. One can check the weather, write an essay, play a game, and communicate with friends all on a single device without having to speak a single word. The problem that a lot of people are seeing arise is how much time young people spend on these devices. It is almost not necessary for most teens, or adults for that matter, to speak face to face with one another, they will just as gladly do it through text messaging. This is becoming a problem with the younger generation because a lot of people feel that to develop the proper communication skills that are needed in everyday life you must know how to communicate to a person directly. The more time the younger generation spends on their phones, the less direct communication they will experience, which will ultimately lead to poor communication skills later in life when texting just will not cut it.</p>
