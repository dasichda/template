		<h1>Lived Experiences</h1>
		<p>I have loved music as far back as I can remember. My father and I always used to go to various concerts and other events involving music, it is something that really helps us relate to one another. When I was approaching the age of sixteen, my main priority after buying a car was the sound system that was going to go into it to make my musical experiences the best they could possibly be.</p>
		<p>I researched everything that went into car audio for hours on end, and to my surprise, there was a lot more to it than what I had originally thought. I thought you were able to just buy speakers and connect a few wires and call it a day. The more I researched, the more fascinated I got, and the more I realized that this was going to be a huge project.</p>
		<p>When I finally turned sixteen and my parents surprised me with my new car, my first thought was getting the subwoofers I had recently purchased up and running. From my research, I learned that you had to also have a car audio amplifier to convert power from the battery and a signal from the radio for the subwoofers to work. That is where it started to get complicated. For an amplifier to work properly, you have to match the output in watts, to the power rating of the subwoofer. The manufacturer gives the power rating of the subwoofer to you. The amplifier also puts out different amounts of power at certain resistances, or ohms, and certain subwoofers can only be wired to a certain resistance. This was all so overwhelming to me, but I loved every minute of it.</p>
		<p>After I figured all of that out, and picked out the perfect amplifier, another problem arose. When connecting a car audio amplifier to your battery, you must first figure out what size wire you have to use, and what size fuse is needed to keep your amplifier safe, but also keep the fuse from blowing. I researched everything I could about this subject. I found out a lot of calculations were needed, and where to get the numbers I needed to use in those calculations. If you use a wire that is too small, it could get too hot and possibly catch your engine compartment on fire, so I needed to be very precise when dealing with this situation.</p>
		<p>Once I had everything hooked up and ready to go, I turned on my car, turned up the speakers and noticed something was not right. My battery meter was nearly bottoming out, this was obviously not good. I did a lot more research and soon figured out that the stock alternator that came with my car was not producing enough power to run the amplifier and all of the electronics in the vehicle. Soon after I found all of this out I started to make calculations on how much amperage was needed to power my amplifier and all of the other electronics. This is not an easy task. You first have to convert the wattage the amplifier produces into amperage. Then you have to look through the manual of the vehicle and figure out how many amperes it requires stock and add the two together.</p>
		<p>After ordering and installing the new alternator I ran into yet another problem, the wires connecting the alternator to the battery were getting very warm, which I mentioned earlier is very dangerous. After a few more calculations I discovered that I needed a larger gauge wire to connect the two to allow the current to move more freely. After changing out the vehicles stock alternator and battery wiring, everything was finally working smoothly, and I was ready to listen to some music.</p>
		<p>I felt so accomplished that I figured everything out on my own with absolutely no outside help besides the Internet. My parents noticed that I was very intrigued with the whole process, and how I managed to solve every problem that was coming my way with ease. Around this time in school, we were told to start brainstorming ideas on what career we wanted to pursue after high school. I had absolutely no ideas when it came to that and never really gave it that much thought before either. I didn’t really have many interests besides sports and figuring out how car audio works. I went home that night and asked my parents for ideas on what I should pursue. They mentioned engineering, since I loved to work hands on and I was able to solve many problems throughout the process of installing just a small portion of my car audio system.</p>
		<p>At that point, I had no idea what engineering even was. My dad basically described it as “solving problems”. That did not help me at all. So they told me to talk to my uncle, who was a robotics engineer. I tried to learn everything I could about engineering from him, and the more I talked to him, the more I realized that this could be my career of choice and what I was meant to do with my life. It also helped that I was extremely proficient at both mathematics and science from a very young age.</p>
		<p>I had never really given any thought as to what kind of engineer I wanted to be until my senior year in high school during my personal finance, where we had to choose a specific career and create an entire portfolio on how different assignments we completed throughout the years, or different experiences helped influence our choice. I was intimidated by the amount of engineering fields there were to get in to. I was partially turned off of the idea of becoming an engineer because of this, until my eyes came across electrical engineering. This field really caught my attention. I read more and more about it and realized that I already did a lot of electrical problem solving subconsciously.</p>
		<p>Electrical engineers work on designing various electronics and electronic systems that will ultimately help the human race as a whole. Basically anything that involves electricity in any way was either partially, or completely designed by an electrical engineer. Not everything goes smoothly in the engineering field though; you have to be ready to deal with any problems that come your way without batting an eye. The best part about engineering is that you work with other engineers as a team to figure out the best and most effective design possible.</p>
		<p>From my experiences in the car audio industry, I already had a lot of hands on experience in the electrical field. I had taught myself how to calculate what size wire could handle certain currents, how to convert electrical units into units that were more useful for the purpose I had in mind, how electricity traveled, and much more beyond that. I was also able to deal with the many problems that I faced throughout the process in a very effective way.</p>
		<p>I was very confident coming into college to pursue my major in electrical engineering. It involves everything that interests me. Everybody tells me that it is a lot of work, and that I won’t make it. This only makes me want to work harder and prove them all wrong. I know that with enough studying and determination, I can make it through these four years at Michigan State University and begin living my dream of being an electrical engineer.</p>
