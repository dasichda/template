			<h1>Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p>	First-year writing classes are nothing to be worried about. If you are anything like me though, the class may give you a good amount of grief. I have never been a terrible writer, I just have a difficult time managing my time wisely and spacing out the individual parts of the assignments. You are given plenty of time to finish everything that needs to be done in this class, so there is no need to worry about deadlines. Just space out the assignments and never leave anything until the last minute. All of the assignments in this class are made to help you become a better writer, so it is up to you to take them seriously and learn as much as you can from them, this will be very beneficial when you begin your higher level writing classes in later years.</p>
			<p>	The Lived Experiences project was an eye opener for me personally. The most stressful part was that I had never written a paper before that had a minimum word count. I had no idea how many words, on average, could fit on each page, so I just started writing as much as I could. One tip that I have would be to cover up the word count at the bottom of your screen, like I am currently doing. The more you look at it, the slower the paper seems to come along. There is a lot you will learn from the first assignment in terms of actual writing though. In this assignment, you are supposed to take a piece of technology that inspired you to choose your major, and describe it in tremendous detail. This is a very important skill to learn early on in your college writing career. Almost every paper is going to involve something that must be described in great detail. Descriptions are what give the reader an insight to what you are talking about. Without a description, a large portion of your paper may not make any sense to the reader. For example, my essay was about how car audio lead me to choose electrical engineering as my major. Most people have no idea about car audio, let alone all of the calculations that are involved as well as the electrical equipment itself. Without a proper description of everything I was talking about, the reader would not have understood the relevance of my topic to electrical engineering. For this assignment you also need to give a detailed description of your major so the audience has an idea of what goes on in that field. This can also be beneficial for you as a writer, because a lot of students choose a major without having any insight as to what is involved. It can really help you make your decision, or change your mind on your current decision.</p>
			<p>	The Cultural Analysis project went a lot smoother for me personally. After the first project I had a much better idea on what was expected in the class. The word count also stressed me out a lot let. I would just write as much as I could on each topic. You also have to be careful about being repetitive. Usually if you cover all of the topics that you are given and write thoroughly about each of them, you will easily meet the minimum requirement. This assignment requires that you find a cultural artifact such as a movie, book, song, etc., and analyze it for references to a cultural issue that we are experiencing as a society today. The main lesson to learn from this assignment is how to analyze a specific item, and relate it to what you are writing about. Knowing how to properly and thoroughly analyze something is very important, especially when you have to relate it back to the rest of your essay. While you are analyzing your subject, you should be taking detailed notes on everything you plan on talking about. You do not want to be referring back to the artifact every time you need more information. Not only does that waste time, but also taking notes will make you write everything down that you see. This is especially important for artifacts that are completely visual, like movies or videos. Sometimes it is not easy to write about exactly what you see. Taking the notes will put you one step closer to completing your final draft by putting everything you see into actual words. Learning to make relations is also a huge part of this assignment. In every piece of writing you do, you will have to make a lot of relations throughout the piece. Making relations will help you connect all of your ideas together to focus on the main topic that you are writing about, while also helping with the flow of your essay as a whole.</p>
			<p>	The Formal Research project is by far the most involved project you will experience in the class. Not only is it the longest by about 1,000 words, but it is also the most information demanding piece. For this project, you must use an information database to find two articles to analyze, conduct two interviews, and last but not least, learn everything you can possibly learn about your current major. Utilizing databases is a very important skill to know for your entire college career and beyond. Databases are a huge collection of reliable information, and it is free to use. Some of your best sources will probably come from some sort of database. As Iâ€™ve discussed in the previous paragraph, knowing how to properly analyze something is a good skill to have. Analyzing an article is a lot different than analyzing a movie or video though. To analyze an article, you first must read through the entire article thoroughly. You may want to read it a few times so you have a really good understanding of what it is all about and so you make sure you did not miss anything the first time around. Taking notes of important details that you are going to want to bring up in your project is not a bad idea either. The more notes you take, the more information you are going to have and the more informative your essay is going to be. More information also makes the actual writing of the essay much easier. The most important skill to learn from this assignment, in my opinion, is how to gather information through interviews. Interviews are a great source of information. If you interview a specialist on the topic you are researching, they can give you a personal response to absolutely any question you have for them. Learning to conduct an interview is just as important as learning to participate in one. By conducting an interview, you gain experience talking to new people and interacting with them in a formal matter. In the process of interviewing these specialists that you have chosen, you can also ask them any questions that you have, even if you do not plan on using that information in your essay. Use this opportunity to further your own knowledge on your current major. Learning as much as you can about your future career is the most important thing you can do while in college.</p>
			<p>	The Multimedia Remix project is quite a bit different than the previous projects. For this project, you are to pick a topic, and create an informative documentary to get your information across to the audience. Information is shared in many ways other than writing, documentaries are just one example. In this documentary you are to conduct another interview, only this time it is not necessarily with a specialist. Conducting random interviews is a good skill to have. It is a great way to get a general consensus on how a group of people feel about controversial issues. Presenting the information itself is also a valuable skill. Writing can be very easy, you just write down your exact thoughts and nobody can take something a different way than how you write it. With video, you must focus on many more elements than just words. Body language and tone, for example, can completely change the way some information was meant to reach the audience. A dramatic tone will convey a more serious message, while a silly tone will make information seem less important. It is up to you to decide where and when to change these elements so your documentary conveys the message you are going for. This project really helps you learn to relay information in other ways than just simply writing it.</p>
			<p>	Overall, this first-year writing class will teach you the basics of almost everything you need to know to be a successful writer. You will learn that description is the most important thing to include in your writing, without it, the audience will have no idea what you are talking about. You will also learn various ways to gather and analyze information, such as databases, interviews, and just research in general. Sharing information is not just about writing though. There are plenty of different ways to convey information. Each way has its own elements that need to be focused on just as much as the information itself. In the end, you will get through it. Just stay focused, learn everything you can, and manage your time wisely.</p>
